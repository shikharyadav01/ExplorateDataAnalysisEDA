# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Customer Churn

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on customer churn data to identify key factors influencing customer retention. The analysis involves data cleaning, visualization, and insights extraction using Python and relevant data science libraries.

## 🗂 Dataset
- **Dataset Name**: Customer Churn Dataset
- **Key Features**:
  - Customer demographics
  - Subscription details
  - Billing information
  - Churn status

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📈 Key Findings
- **Churn Rate**: 26.5% of customers have churned, while 73.5% remain active.
- **Demographic Influence**: Senior citizens have a churn rate of 41.2%, significantly higher than the overall churn rate.
- **Contract Type**: Month-to-month contracts show a 45.6% churn rate, whereas yearly contracts have only 11.3%.
- **Billing Impact**: Customers with higher monthly charges (above $70) churn at 39.8%, compared to 17.6% for those below $50.

## 📊 Visualizations
- Count plots
- Pie charts
- Bar charts & histograms
- Correlation heatmaps

## 🔍 Insights & Recommendations
- Targeted retention strategies for high-risk segments (senior citizens, high-billing customers).
- Encourage long-term contracts to reduce churn rates.
- Improve customer service and engagement to enhance satisfaction.
